## Hello there 👋
I'm Agustaya, a computer engineering student based in Chicago. I'm interested in applied engineering projects, especially ones related to vehicles.

I'm currently a circuitry subteam member working on creating the PDM (Power Distribution Module) for the UIC SAE Formula E racecar.

The tools and technologies I am familiar with are: Altium Designer, C, C++, Arm Assembly, and Circuitverse.
